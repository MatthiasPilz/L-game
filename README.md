# L-game
play the L-game against the computer

This is my first 'project' (I'm still figuring out the difference between project and repository) using git. I will try to write some sort of documentation of the process as I go along.



##### day zero:
- created a repository and a project for this little project
- trying to figure out what the difference is and how to make use of it
- defined a couple of tasks

##### day one:
- print empty board and starting position
- not entirely certain whether notation for position is sensible
- try to adapt something similar to FEN notation in chess

##### day two:
- still not sure how to make use of the 'project' tab on github... this might be useful for collaborations!?
- was reading old code from a chess implementation and decided that I should also implement this game in C (also to get back into it :) )
- created a branch to keep the python files
- create printing functions in C and define board struct
- added a lot of comments all throughout the code

##### day three:
- implemented a function to input new L position
- used this to test whether all positions do what they are expected to

##### day four:
- extended previous input function to also receive coin move
- parse input to obtain integer representation
- test get_move() function
